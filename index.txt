A Comprehensive and Queryable Knowledge Database of Projects
============================================================

TIP: This web page describes Orion and makes its data available to the
public.

************************************************************************
Software projects produce a wealth of data that
is leveraged in different tasks and for different purposes: researchers
collect project data for building experimental datasets;
software programmers reuse code from projects; developers often
explore the opportunities for getting involved in the development
of a project to gain or offer expertise. Finding relevant projects
that suit one needs is however currently challenging with the
capabilities of existing search systems.

We propose 'Orion', an integrated search engine architecture
that combines information from different types of software
repositories from multiple sources to facilitate the construction
and execution of advanced search queries. Orion provides a
declarative query language that gives to users access to a uniform
interface where it transparently correlates different artifacts of
project development and maintenance.

We have built an extensible system with an initial capability
of over 100,000 projects collected from the web, featuring
several types of software repositories and software development
artifacts. We conducted an experiment with 10 search scenarios
to compare Orion with traditional search engines, and study
the expressiveness, the usability and the productivity of our
approach. The results show with strong statistical significance
that users find relevant projects faster and more accurately with
Orion.

- Navigate to the *Documentation* page for an overview of the
'database' contents and of the 'Orion DSL' translation mechanisms.

- Go to the *Download* page to access the project list and retrieve
  2 GB of processed information

- The *Testing* page will soon contain an online interface for the search
  engine where users can specify query requests in Orion DSL specifications
  and get results.

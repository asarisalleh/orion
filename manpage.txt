Orion in details
================

---------------------------------------------------------------
The main objective of Orion is to reduce the gap between userâ€™s
search intent and the interpretation that search engines associate
to search queries. To this end, we propose to use a
domain-specific language to formulate search specifications
that describe the criteria for selecting relevant projects. The
queries written with the high-level Orion DSL are translated
into low-level advanced database queries where several information
tables are joined to select, from a knowledge database,
a set of projects. This knowledge database of projects is
constructed and maintained by crawling the web for project
code and development artifacts
